One of the bigest lessons learned from this project was the importace of generating a complete bill of materials before starting the project. Having a single shopping list and ordering all the parts delivered could have saved us a TON of time. Becuase we never generated one I do not have a complete list, I will do my best to link to the general materials used as a reference.
